    "# Social Media Sentiment Analysis\n",

    "__BACKGROUND__\n",
    "\n",
    "A large multinational corporation is seeking to automatically identify the sentiment that their customer base talks about on social media. They would like to expand this capability into multiple languages. Many 3rd party tools exist for sentiment analysis, however, they need help with under-resourced languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "__GOAL__\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a sentiment classifier (Positive, Negative, Neutral) on a corpus of the provided documents. Your goal is to maximize accuracy. There is special interest in being able to accurately detect negative sentiment. The training data includes documents from a wide variety of sources, not merely social media, and some of it may be inconsistently labeled. Please describe the business outcomes in your work sample including how data limitations impact your results and how these limitations could be addressed in a larger project.\n",
